  <h1 class = "chill" > Hi, I'm Alfred. I bet you've heard a lot about terrorism over the last couple of years. Some people say that people who are very afraid of terrorism are overreacting, others disagree.
  What do you think? How do you feel? Have a chat with me and I'll give you the REAl information about terrorism and whether or not you should be afraid. You can begin chatting with me down below.</h1>
