<h2 class = "mission" > Alfred is a chatbot centered around the topic of terrorism and national security. Depending on whether the responses given to the questions asked are positive or negative, Alfred will agree with and reinforce these ideas. The idea we wanted to explore was what kind of tension surrounds terrorism in the United States and whether or not its citizens are actively afraid of it. Due to an increase of terrorism being reported in the news, it can be assumed that attacks are becoming more frequent and will effect in our everyday lives. We found that depending on which news source reports on the topic the information is very different and will sway feelings of security or fear; e.g. CNN is more likely to produce fear than The Washington Post. We wanted to prove how people stay in their personal media bubbles, surrounded by like minded ideas and people. Alfred will agree with your point of view of terrorism and reinforce it, showing the dangers of only viewing one type of news source. You can “trust” him, he is your “friend.”</h2>
